## Project Overview ##

Create a library database application using Python and SQLite.

 # Steps: #

  Project Specifications (10 Points) -- could potentially be time-consuming
  
  ERD Design (15 Points) -- could potentially be time-consuming
  
  BCNF (15 Points) -- not too time-consuming
  
  SQL Schema (15 Points) -- not too time-consuming once previous 3 steps are done
  
  Populating Tables (15 Points) -- not too time-consuming
  
  Building the Application (20 Points) -- most likely the most time-consuming part.
  

Some Notes:

Project Specifications:
  - Elements to consider
      - Entities -> books, magazines, users, personnel, etc.
      - Relationships -> borrowing, returning, attending events
      - Attributes -> title, date, etc.
      - Rules (implemented as triggers) -> futureItems, etc.

ERD Design:
  - Use lucidchart

Does your design allow anomalies:
  - Review if FDs are in BCNF. Reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity.
  - Identify non-trivial FDs, decompose the table until BCNF.

Build Database Application:
  1. Find an item in the library.
  2. Borrow an item from the library.
  3. Return a borrowed item.
  4. Donate an item to the library.
  5. Find an event in the library.
  6. Register for an event.
  7. Volunteer for library-related activities.
  8. Ask for help from a librarian.


## Tentative Timeline ##

Today: March 5th

Week of March 10th - March 16th
